# Problem-Solving
My personal DSA learning journey — clean and simple C++ programs covering all basic and intermediate data structures and algorithms.

# Data Structures & Algorithms – Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal practice code for learning and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
All programs are written in **C/C++**, covering essential topics such as arrays, strings, searching, sorting, recursion, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and many more.
